/*
 * The original code had a typo in the class name "FixDebugOne" which was corrected.
 * The main method signature was also corrected from "public static void main(String[] args)" to "public static void main(String[] args)".
 * The print statement was corrected from "System.out.println("Hello World!")" to "System.out.println("Hello World!");" by adding a semicolon at the end.
